![Tom]({{ site.url }}/assets/tom_white.jpg)

I was born in 1973 and grew up in [Ironbridge, Shropshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironbridge).
I studied mathematics at [Queens' College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens%27_College,_Cambridge),
then did a masters in philosophy of science at Leeds and Florence.

In 1996 I moved to London to start work at [Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters), where I learnt C and HTML, and the
then newly-minted Java programming language. I then worked at a small Java consultancy
called Objective, before joining Kizoom in 1999. Kizoom was my first startup - we built
apps to make commuters lives easier by providing services to plan train journeys, get alerted
to tube delays, or find out when the next bus was due.

In 1998 I met Eliane, and our daughters were born in 2002 and 2004. In 2007 we left
London and moved to Crickhowell in the [Brecon Beacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecon_Beacons) in Wales.
I had been dabbling in a new technology called [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), and
it seemed like as good a time as any to take the plunge and become a Hadoop consultant
(the world's first), doing work for companies like Last.fm and Ning. I was also made a Hadoop
committer, and got more involved with the wider [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/),
eventually serving on various [project committees](http://hadoop.apache.org/who.html)
and becoming a [member of the foundation](http://www.apache.org/foundation/members.html).

In 2008 I started writing a [book about Hadoop](http://www.hadoopbook.com/). The first edition was published by O'Reilly
the following year; it was launched at the Hadoop Summit and every attendee was given a copy.
The book became a bestseller, and I wrote four editions in total, which were translated into three languages.

2008 was a busy year, since in addition to writing a book, I joined [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/),
the Hadoop startup, as its second employee.
Then just one year later, Eliane, the girls, and I upped sticks again and moved to San Francisco,
where we lived until we returned to Wales in 2012.
At Cloudera, I continued my work on core Hadoop and its growing ecosystem of projects
and tools. Then in 2014 I moved roles at Cloudera from engineering to the data science team, where I got
a taste for solving challenging problems in big data, like genomics (previously I had
been building the systems that others used to solve the problems).

In 2018 I went freelance, working for the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) on their genomics toolkit
([GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)), and in Uri Laserson's lab at
[Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/) on single cell software tools. In both cases I was concerned
with making the software run faster and scale to bigger datasets. The single cell work was focused around
[Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/) and related SciPy projects ([UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/),
[pynndescent](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent)).

In 2020 I paused my freelance work to spend time on various community
data analysis and [visualization](http://tom-e-white.com/datavision/) projects.
Then in early March, as coronavirus began to spread, I began [collating the disparate sources of UK COVID-19 data](https://github.com/tomwhite/covid-19-uk-data).

In June 2020, I went back to the world of big data and genomics and joined Jeff Hammerbacher's team at [Related Sciences](https://www.related.vc/) to work on [sgkit](https://github.com/pystatgen/sgkit), a statistical genetics toolkit based on PyData technologies like Dask, Xarray, and Zarr.
