In 2013, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-21496562">Brecon Beacons was designated</a> a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark-sky_preserve">Dark Sky Reserve</a>, and a year later the first <a href="http://www.darkskiesfestival.org/">Dark Skies Festival</a> was held in Hay-on-Wye. The second festival took place this weekend, and my family went along to some of the activities.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XZZec7XJw6E/VTPbECGaUlI/AAAAAAAAAjk/Yj1c11ww4lk/s1600/20150418_195650.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XZZec7XJw6E/VTPbECGaUlI/AAAAAAAAAjk/Yj1c11ww4lk/s1600/20150418_195650.jpg" height="180" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Young stargazers, Lottie and Millie</td></tr></tbody></table>In the morning, we found ourselves in a planetarium tent, then we looked at sunspots, and held pieces of meteorite.<br /><br />The evening event was stargazing at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZC9tT">Holy Trinity Church</a> in Hardwicke, just outside Hay. Quite apart from the lack of light pollution, the location was a special one, since the vicar of the parish from 1856 until 1885 was&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_William_Webb">Reverend Thomas William Webb</a>, who in his spare time observed the night sky with telescopes and an observatory he had built himself.<br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s88Tgu6Nghw/VTPbCIgz7lI/AAAAAAAAAjc/4NGSKnkiUyQ/s1600/20150418_195131.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-s88Tgu6Nghw/VTPbCIgz7lI/AAAAAAAAAjc/4NGSKnkiUyQ/s1600/20150418_195131.jpg" height="320" width="180" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Holy Trinity Church, Hardwicke</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In 1859, while at Hardwicke he wrote the classic book,&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/celestialobject02webbgoog">Celestial Objects for the Common Telescope</a>, the object of which was "to furnish the possessors of ordinary telescopes with plain directions for their use, and a list of objects for their advantageous employment".<br /><br />The book remained in print well into the following century (and was recently <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/astronomy/observational-astronomy-techniques-and-instrumentation/celestial-objects-common-telescopes">republished by Cambridge University Press</a>), and it's probably difficult to overemphasise the importance of this book in encouraging generation after generation of amateur stargazers.<br /><br />In the words of <a href="http://www.herefordshirelife.co.uk/people/herefordshire_people_reverend_thomas_webb_the_stargazer_of_hardwicke_1_1632990">Janet and Mark Robinson</a>, who used to live in the vicarage and have edited <a href="http://www.gracewing.co.uk/page334.html">a book about Webb</a>,<br /><blockquote>Like Patrick Moore, he was an enthusiast who wanted to inspire as many people as possible to look through a telescope. Even at the choir party he "arranged the telescope and acted as showman and all in turn had a look at Saturn".</blockquote>Webb would no doubt have been pleased to see yesterday's gathering of enthusiastic amateurs (including the Robinsons) with an impressive range of telescopes, on a cold but very clear night. The highlight for us was seeing Jupiter and its four brightest moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) through a large reflecting telescope. We could even see the north and south belts, and the Great Red Spot (or Pink Splodge as Lottie named it).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5XY8r0pvNU8/VTPbNIkL2yI/AAAAAAAAAjs/IiWWKbEO4Iw/s1600/20150418_210623.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5XY8r0pvNU8/VTPbNIkL2yI/AAAAAAAAAjs/IiWWKbEO4Iw/s1600/20150418_210623.jpg" height="180" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Sunset.
