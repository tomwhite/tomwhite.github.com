The Cloudera team have just released a <a href="http://community.cloudera.com/">website</a> which has a few reports on various Hadoop development metrics. I like the <a href="http://community.cloudera.com/reports/2/issues/">Most Watched Open Jira Issues</a>, as it gives a good summary of what Hadoop Core developers are thinking about.<br /><br />Personally, I can't wait for the new MapReduce API (<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-1230">HADOOP-1230</a>), which is currently the third most watched issue.
