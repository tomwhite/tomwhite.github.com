MD5 and cryptographic hash functions in general have many uses - not least integrity checking and password storage. They have the property of <i>mixing</i> the input in an unpredictable but <i>deterministic</i> way. This can be very useful - and not just in security applications. Here are two great examples I came across recently: <a href="http://exp-platform.com/hippo.aspx">partitioning users into groups for controlled experiments on the web</a>, and <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/">Dopplr</a>'s <a href="http://blog.dopplr.com/index.php/2007/10/23/in-rainbows/">colour-coding of cities</a>. Neat.
