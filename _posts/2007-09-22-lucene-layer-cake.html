With a <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/PigProposal">proposal for Pig</a> (a query language interface for very large datasets) to go into the Apache Incubator, it looks like the Lucene family is growing once more. With so many members it gets harder to track the inter-project dependencies, so I created a quick <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/publish/1288472/">family portrait</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: not long after writing this I noticed this <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-1913#action_12529598">patch</a> to run Lucene on Hbase (a part of Hadoop) - so now my diagram's wrong. It was a bit of an oversimplification anyway - it's meant to give a rough idea of the building blocks of Lucene.
