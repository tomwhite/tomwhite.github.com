<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/">Ohloh</a> seems to be positioning itself as the social networking site of the open source project world. It's also worth having a look at for its neat visualizations. I particularly like the sparklines showing <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/5106/analyses/latest/contributors">commit activity</a> for each committer on a project, the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3564/analyses/latest">codebase history</a> showing the number of lines of code over time, and the ability to <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/compare">compare projects</a> graphically (a bit like Google Trends). These tools are great for getting a quick feel for a project that you can't really find from its website or source code repository.
