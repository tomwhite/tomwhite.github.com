<br /><div class="p1">A couple of weeks ago I made a new kitchen table.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-03-30-image-0002.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-03-30-image-0000.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span id="goog_1670473399"></span><span id="goog_1670473400"></span><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">It was much easier than it looks as all I had to do was attach some hairpin legs to a worktop. If you haven't seen hairpin legs before, here's a closeup:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-03-30-image-0003.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2013-03-30-image-0001.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><br /></div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Eliane got the idea for the design after seeing something similar on the web, and she ordered the worktop from <a href="http://www.worktop-express.co.uk/">Worktop Express</a>, and the hairpin legs from the <a href="http://www.theironmill.co.uk/">Iron Mill</a>.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">I worked out what size screws to use (#12) and the pilot drill size using <a href="http://www.wlfuller.com/html/wood_screw_chart.html">this handy chart</a>. I also found a tip somewhere that said putting a little wax on the screw makes it easier to drive in with hardwoods (our worktop is oak).</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The table is pretty sturdy, and hasn't collapsed! It was quicker to put together than some Ikea furniture, and it's very satisfying having an everyday piece of furniture that we designed and built ourselves.</div>
