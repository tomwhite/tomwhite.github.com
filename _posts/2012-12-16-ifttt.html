<a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, pronounced "ift", and which stands for "if this then that", is a great service for wiring bits of the internet together.  The idea is that you create rules for performing actions, based on triggers.<br /><b><br /></b><b>If this</b>&nbsp;[trigger] occurs&nbsp;<b>then</b> perform <b>that</b>&nbsp;[action].<br /><br />There are lots of triggers and actions, provided by <a href="https://ifttt.com/channels">channels</a>. For example, the <a href="https://ifttt.com/weather">Weather Channel</a> provides a trigger which fires at sunset. And the <a href="https://ifttt.com/google_talk">Google Talk Channel</a> provides an action to send a chat message. I combined the trigger and action into a <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/70456">recipe</a> called "Did you put the chickens to bed?" which will remind me (and Eliane) to close the chicken shed in the evening.<br /><action><br /></action><action>I love the simplicity of the whole thing. I quickly added a recipe to send a weekly SMS to remind me to put the rubbish out. And one to send an email to Lottie when there is a full moon. Emilia created a recipe to send her an email when a friend of hers posts something on his blog. I fear the recipe that tells me when it has started raining will be deleted soon due to email overload.</action><br /><action><br /></action>When you start thinking in this way, the more interesting uses invariably involve the the physical world in some way. I want to have a recipe that says "if we're running out of coffee beans then order some more", or "if I'm on Skype light up a lamp outside my office so the kids know not to come in" (this one is close with the <a href="https://ifttt.com/blink1">blink(1)</a> device), or even "it's actually dark now and you still haven't closed the chicken shed door".
