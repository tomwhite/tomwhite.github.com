Although I've seen the other variants (and used some of them myself), Google call it <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">"MapReduce"</a>, so that seems like the right thing to call it to me, since they invented it. The usage figures seem to back up this conclusion. "MapReduce" (no space) has 87,000 Google hits, while "Map Reduce" (with space) has only 50,200, and the latter includes "Map/Reduce" and "Map-Reduce" variants, since Google (and search engines in general) ignore punctuation.<br /><br />In this age of case sensitivity and camel case one has to watch out for these things. In fact, I've only just realised that the Hadoop database is called "HBase", not "Hbase". The curse of <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hbase">wiki names</a>. And the logo doesn't help either - it's all caps!
