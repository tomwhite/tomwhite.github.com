I caught the second half of <a href="http://www.bandweblogs.com/blog/2007/11/16/parallel-worlds-parallel-lives-bbc-four-documentary-about-eels-founder-mark-everett-and-his-father/">Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives</a> on BBC Four last night, where Mark Everett of the band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eels_%28band%29">Eels</a> travelled around the US to find out about his father Hugh Everett III, the physicist who developed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">Many Worlds Interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics. (New Scientist has a good <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19626311.800-interview-parallel-lives-can-never-touch.html">interview</a> with him too.)<br /><br />I read Everett senior's <a href="http://www.univer.omsk.su/omsk/Sci/Everett/paper1957.html">landmark paper</a> when I was doing my Master's degree, and at the time I agreed with Paul Davies' view that Many Worlds is "cheap on assumptions but expensive on universes". I later read David Deutsch's <a href="http://www.qubit.org/people/david/FabricOfReality/FoR.html">The Fabric of Reality</a>, and I was prepared to give the theory more time - but even so, I still find it a lot to ask. (It's better than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation">Copenhagen Interpretation</a> though.) Not long after finishing my degree I got into Eels and saw them play live in London.<br /><br />Only now do I know the connection. A fascinating programme.
