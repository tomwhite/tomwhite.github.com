title: "My EMF 2024 Highlights"
---

My [Electromagnetic Field 2024](https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024) highlights, in rough chronological order:

- On Thursday I volunteered as an entrance steward, and in the bar. I've never worked in a bar before, and it was hard but exhilarating work as there's lots to learn (pulling pints, and the till system).
- Someone had converted a Henry hoover into a radio-controlled robot.
- In the intro talk, [Jonty](https://mstdn.social/@jonty@chaos.social) said that 43 festivals have been cancelled this year. Also EMF had _three times_ as many talk proposals as last time, and they're not sure why. And EMF Camp is staying put - they now have a 40Gb/s wired connection to the festival site!
- [PINECIL soldering irons](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/) look nice. (From Drew Batchelor's "The Tiny Tool Kit Manifesto" talk, see [https://tinytoolk.it/](https://tinytoolk.it/).)
- I went to Matthew Macdonald-Wallace's talk about building a rural makerspace, and learned that he set up [Make Monmouth](https://makemonmouth.co.uk/) which is only a 40-minute drive from me.
- Tim Jacobs talked about four iterations of his digital clock in "GPS time, leap seconds, and a clock that's always right". DST is a horror at the best of times, but if you want your clock to work everywhere then it's another level.
- Iain Sharp has built a lovely mechanical version of the arcade classic, [Lunar Lander](https://lushprojects.com/lunarlandermk2/), which he talked about in the EMF Arcade. It was nice to see Tim Hunkin there in the audience, as it's now at [Southwold Pier](https://www.underthepier.com/) which hosts many of Tim's creations. Iain's new flappy bird game was in the bar, attracting a lot of attention. (I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that Ian is the creator of [CircuitJS](https://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/), which I used for my [8-bit computer simulation](https://github.com/tomwhite/8-bit-computer) last year.)
- Maker hero [Tim Hunkin](https://www.timhunkin.com/) gave a wonderful talk, "A Short History of Electric Shocks", which was full of arresting images and gentle humour. My only regret was that I forgot to bring my copy of "Almost Everything There is to Know" for him to sign.

- For lasers, Seb Lee-Delisle is the man. His talk also included a flappy bird game, projected on the tent wall using lasers. As if that wasn't enough, later on he projected a playable asteroids game onto the hillside!
- At the Maths Jam, Matthew Scroggs gave a lightning talk about the maths behind "Big Ben Strikes Again", an episode of _Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons_ when Big Ben strikes 13. It's all in this [blog post](https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/blog/44), including a video reproducing the phenomenon.
- A 5km run around the deer park.
- [George Cave](https://interactionmagic.com/) kicked off the Saturday talks with "Connecting Arduinos to websites: A sequence of chaotic live demos" - he did both parts of the title with aplomb. New things for me: `chrome://device-log/`, stretch sensors, WebUSB, Adafruit ItsyBitsy, more [here](https://github.com/Interaction-Magic/prototyping-hardware-web-talk).
- My favourite talk was Skylar MacDonald's "How to Save a Life" - about what happens when you dial 999. Fascinating subject; flawless fast-paced delivery; packed with technical nuggets.
- Michael Arntzenius wrote FizzBuzz in Emacs using his voice in his "Writing computer code by voice" talk. Mesmerising - it's definitely worth a watch when the videos are made available! The key tech is [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) and [Cursorless](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pokey.cursorless) (for VSCode).
- Richard Wiseman suffered AV issues while the audience waited - sadly, they couldn't be fixed - but he gave a delightful magic show without any slides in "Magic Your Mind Happy".
- I got a ticket to Joe Nash's workshop "Eavesdropping on Eastnor’s bats: an introduction to bioacoustics in the field". The bonus was that, after learning the theory, we got to build a [π•pistrelle bat detector](https://www.omenie.com/about-pipistrelle.html), and then go for a bat walk at dusk. The build involved surface mount devices, which I have never used before and are tiny and difficult to place on the PCB - so it was great being in a group (led by Kliment) all working alongside each other. Thankfully my detector worked, and we saw (and heard) lots of bats near the lake. What a treat.
- Neil Monteiro's "From Makerspace to Outer Space" was a good way to start Sunday, and this stat jumped out at me: there are 1,300 space companies in the UK.
- PINECIL came up again in doop's "Practicalities of being a walking lightshow" talk, which packed a lot of tips about the options (glow sticks, UV reactive, electroluminescence, LEDs) into 20 minutes. His recommendation for "beatmatching" (to music) was to ignore AI and keep it simple - do it manually with a button to set the beat based on a couple of clicks.
- Andy Piper was asked the question "Where is the Art?" when he and his partner were showing their pen plotter art at a local art exhibition. His talk deftly mixed history with practical tips ranging from the simplest pen plotter (the charming [BrachioGraph](https://www.brachiograph.art/en/latest/)) to the much more capable AxiDraw.
