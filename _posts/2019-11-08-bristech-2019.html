What a great conference! It’s one day, three tracks.<br /><br /><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--> The thing I like about it is the variety of the talks. It’s not organized around a single programming language or technology, so it’s easy to go to talks outside your usual sphere of interest (it’s quite hard not to). I went to talks about MLOps (keynote by Luke Marsden), the Language Server Protocol (by Krzysztof Cieślak), a reactive JS compiler called Svelte (by Peter Allen), accessibility (by&nbsp;Svetlana Kouznetsova), Cloud Native ML (by&nbsp;Ant Kennedy), and building autonomous Mars rovers (by&nbsp;Mark Woods).&nbsp;I gave a talk on Single Cell data and algorithms (thanks to Steve&nbsp;Loughran for suggesting I submit it, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/steveloughran/status/1192410323988500480">live tweeting</a> it!).<br /><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--> <br /><div>Nic Hemley and the other organizers put a lot of work into lots of small details that made the day more memorable. To name a few: the Icelandic thunder clap; caterpillar and butterfly stickers to encourage attendees to talk to each other; lunchtime <a href="https://www.larkhall.org/">music and visuals</a>; cinema popcorn.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--> As a speaker I was very impressed by the care taken by track chairs on the speaker intros. Speakers were asked beforehand to fill in a short “interview” document, which chairs then used to write an intro for each speaker. My track chair was <a href="https://opcan.co.uk/">Hannah Smith</a> who was also very good at gently reminding people in the Q&amp;A session to ask questions rather than give their opinions. So we didn’t have any “this is more of a comment than a question” style ramblings, which I’m sure everyone was pleased about.</div><div><br /></div><div><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--> And the Watershed is a very nice venue, even if it gets “<a href="https://twitter.com/dancookdev/status/1192712736066744321">night club busy</a>” between talks.</div><div><br /></div><div><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--> Great conference. Highly recommended.</div>
