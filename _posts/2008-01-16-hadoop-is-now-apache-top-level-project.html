Doug Cutting just reported on the Hadoop lists that the Apache board voted this morning (US time) to make Hadoop a TLP. Until now it has been a Lucene subproject, which made sense when Hadoop was broken out from the Nutch codebase two years ago. Since then Hadoop has grown dramatically. This change will make it possible for a number of associated projects - such as <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-hadoop/Hbase">HBase</a> and <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/pig/">Pig</a> - to become Hadoop subprojects in their own right. (There are more details in the <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Hadoop-TLP--td14326977.html">original discussion</a>.)<br /><br />Thanks for looking after us Lucene - it's been a great time so far and we'll keep in touch!
