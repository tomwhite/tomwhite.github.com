<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/2008-05-30-image-0001.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2008-05-30-image-0000.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5206216384927168578" border="0" /></a>Today I visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raglan_Castle">Raglan Castle</a> in Monmouthshire with my family. <a href="http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/">Cadw</a>, the government body that manages the castle, were running a trial to deliver audio files to visitors' mobile phones using Bluetooth. As I walked through the entrance I simply made my phone discoverable, waited a few seconds for the MP3 to download, then started listening to a <a href="http://www.cadw-feedback.org.uk/audio_en.html">guided tour</a> of the castle. It's a great use of the technology: it just worked.<br /><br />The talk only lasted a few minutes, so we had plenty of time afterwards to run around the ruins.<br /><br />A couple of technical questions that sprang to mind:<br /><ol><li>How would you set up a server to push files over Bluetooth? (There are loads of ways you could use this - maps of the local area at transport hubs, sharing the schedule at conferences, random photo of the day at home, etc.)<br /></li><li>Can you make audio files navigable? That is, make it easy to go to the part of audio file that is about a given exhibit by typing in the exhibit's number? (This problem reminds me of Cliff Schmidt's <a href="http://www.eu.apachecon.com/eu2008/program/talk/2625.html">talk</a> about the Talking Book Device at ApacheCon EU 2008.)<br /></li></ol>
