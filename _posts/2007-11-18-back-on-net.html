Yesterday, after a month of waiting, we got broadband at our new house. Hooray!<br /><br />Last time I was <a href="http://problemsworthyofattack.blogspot.com/2007/08/two-weeks-off-net.html">without net access</a> it was fun - it was just for a two week holiday.  This time the whole experience was frustrating, since it wasn't self-imposed: we were dragged into the labyrinthine machine of BT/Openreach and of course we didn't know how long it would take to get out. Eliane's got <a href="http://faites-simple.blogspot.com/2007/11/british-telecom-good-bad-and-ugly.html">the gory details</a> - all I have to add is that <a href="http://www.eclipse.net.uk/">Eclipse Internet</a>, our broadband supplier, provided excellent support every time I rang.<br /><br />Still, it gave me the chance to practise lighting fires in the wood-burning stove.
