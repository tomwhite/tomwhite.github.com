Last July I asked "<a href="http://www.lexemetech.com/2007/07/why-are-there-no-amazon-s3ec2.html">Why are there no Amazon S3/EC2 competitors?</a>", lamenting the lack of competition in the utility or cloud computing market and the implications for disaster recovery. Closely tied to disaster recover is <span style="font-style: italic;">portability</span> -- the ability to switch between different utility computing providers as easily as I switch electricity suppliers. (OK, that can be a pain, at least in the UK, but it doesn't require rewiring my house.)<br /><br />It's useful to compare <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> with Google's recently launched <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> in these terms. In some sense they compete, but they are strikingly different offerings. Amazon's services are <span style="font-style: italic;">bottom up</span>: "here's a CPU, now install your own software". Google's is <span style="font-style: italic;">top down</span>: "write some code to these APIs and we'll scale it for you". There's no way I can take my EC2 services and run them on App Engine. But I can do the reverse -- sort of -- thanks to <a href="http://appdrop.com/">AppDrop.</a><br /><br />And that's the thing. What I would love is a utility service from different providers that I can switch between. That's one of the meanings of "utility", after all. (Moving lots of data between providers may make this difficult or expensive to do in practice -- "data inertia" -- but that's not a reason not to have the capability.)<br /><br />There are at least two ways this can happen. One's the AppDrop approach -- emulate Google's API and provide an alternative place to run applications, in this case it's EC2.<br /><br />However, there's another way: build "standard, non-proprietary cloud APIs with open-source implementations", as Doug Cutting says on his blog post <a href="http://blog.lucene.com/2008/04/09/cloud-commodity-or-proprietary/">Cloud: commodity or proprietary?</a> In this world, applications use a common API, and host with whichever provider they fancy. Bottom up offerings like Amazon's facilitate this approach: the underlying platforms may differ, but it's easy to run your application on the provided platform -- for example, by building an Amazon AMI. Google's top down approach is not so amenable, application developers are locked-in to the APIs Google provide. (Of course, Google may open this platform up more over time, but it remains to be seen if they will open it up to the extent of being able to run arbitrary executables.)<br /><br />As Doug notes, <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> is providing a lot of the building blocks for building cloud services: filesystem (<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/">HDFS</a>), database (<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/">HBase</a>), computation (<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/">MapReduce</a>), coordination (<a href="http://zookeeper.sourceforge.net/">ZooKeeper</a>). And here, perhaps, is where the two approaches may meet -- AppDrop could be backed by HBase (or indeed <a href="http://www.hypertable.org/">Hypertable</a>), or HBase (and Hypertable) could have an open API which your application could use directly.<br /><br />Rails or Django on HBase, anyone?
