Tim O'Reilly has a written a nice <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/08/yahoos_bet_on_h.html">piece about Hadoop</a>, following its starring role at OSCON. I was tickled pink to see that he linked to my article about running Hadoop on Amazon EC2 to do log analysis!<br /><br />Also, from the comments: Google has some <a href="http://code.google.com/edu/content/parallel.html">courseware</a> on MapReduce and Hadoop. Everyone seems to love Hadoop at the moment.
