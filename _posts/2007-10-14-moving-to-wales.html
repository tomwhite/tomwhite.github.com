Next week we are moving to the <a href="http://www.breconbeacons.org/">Brecon Beacons</a> in Wales. This is a big change for us: I've been living in London for the past 11 years and Eliane for the last 17. But in some ways it's not so big as we both grew up in small towns. We're renting a barn on a hill, and Eliane is already <a href="http://faites-simple.blogspot.com/2007/09/where-is-it-i-want-it-now.html">planning the veg patch</a>.<br /><br />Work-wise I shall be leaving <a href="http://www.kizoom.com/">Kizoom</a> at the end of November. I am one of the three original members (with <a href="http://www.kizoom.com/about_us/profiles.html">Nick Knowles</a> and <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?browse=MikeStorey">Mike Storey</a>) of the team that started Kizoom in September 1999, in Nick's library (Islington people have libraries <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> garages).<br /><br />After that I shall be working freelance and specializing in Hadoop. The plan is to work from home as much as possible, but I'm realistic about the need to travel to make this happen. So - if you need help with a Hadoop-related project, please get in touch.
