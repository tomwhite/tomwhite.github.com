Coinciding nicely with Jakob Nielson's admonition <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/articles-not-blogs.html">Write Articles, Not Blog Postings</a> (via <a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/publish/5">Steve Loughran</a>) here's my latest article, <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=873&amp;categoryID=100">Running Hadoop MapReduce on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3</a>, published on <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/index.jspa">Amazon Web Services Developer Connection</a>.<br /><br />It's almost a year and a half since I wrote my <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/02/16/introduction-to-nutch-2.html">last article</a> and one of the reasons is because I've <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/">blogged</a> more. Not much, but more.<br /><br />Jakob's got a point about being directed to short, old, irrelevant blog postings when you're looking for something. He's not saying don't blog, but rather try to write stuff that will be long-lived. Definitely something to aim for for tech writers - but not at the cost of not writing anything (so it's OK to sprinkle blogs with lighter weight stuff).
