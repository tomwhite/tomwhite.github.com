A couple of quick updates on the <a href="http://www.hadoopbook.com/">Hadoop book</a> I'm writing. The Pig chapter is now available on <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/9780596521974?cid=orm-cat-readnow-9780596521974">Safari</a>. It still has a few holes, but I'd love to hear feedback on it.<br /><br />Also included is a Hadoop case study from Last.fm. Thanks to Adrian Woodhead and Marc de Palol for writing it.
