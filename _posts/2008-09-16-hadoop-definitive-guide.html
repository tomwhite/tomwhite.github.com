<span style="font-weight:bold;">Update:</span> Fixed feedback link.<br /><br />The Rough Cut of <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596521998/index.html">Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</a> is now up on O'Reilly's site. There are a few chapters available already, at various stages of completion. Remember, it's still pretty rough. I'd love to hear any suggestions for improvements that you may have though. You can submit feedback from <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/9780596521974">Safari</a> where the book is hosted. As the <a href="http://oreilly.com/roughcuts/faq.csp">Rough Cuts FAQ</a> explains, I'd like feedback on missing topics, if something is not understandable, and technical mistakes.<br /><br />Now I just need to go and write the rest of it...
