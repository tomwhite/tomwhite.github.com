I made this image a few years ago (as a postcard to give to friends), but it's appropriate to show again today as it's a neat visual demonstration that Easter this year is the earliest this century.<br /><br /><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/8797345@N02/2355962134/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2288/2355962134_b29b261631_d.jpg" width="349" height="500" alt="101 Easters"/></a><br /><br /><br />The scale at the bottom shows the maximum range of Easter: from 22 March to 25 April.
