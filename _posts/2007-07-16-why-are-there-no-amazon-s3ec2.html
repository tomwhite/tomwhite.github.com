Amazon's storage and compute services (S3 and EC2 respectively) are widely seen as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/14/amazon-grid-storage-web-service-launches/">game </a><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/24.html">changers</a>. So, almost one year on from EC2's launch, why is it that there are no competitors in this space? One commenter on Artur Bergman's post entitled <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/06/amazon_ec2_and.html">Amazon Web Services and the lack of a SLA</a> made the good point that a "competitive utility computing market" would effectively solve any disaster recovery problems, and make such services even more popular.<br /><br />Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/13/40-terabytes-more-data-for-amazon-s3">TechCrunch reports</a> a rumour that Amazon will offer a MySQL web service by the end of the year.
