Some of the projects I've worked on, and my areas of interest and expertise, in no particular order:

## Hadoop

I was one of the first committers on [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), and worked on it and many other distributed systems projects in the Hadoop ecosystem for the best part of a decade while working at [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/). I wrote four editions of the bestselling book [Hadoop: The Definitive Guide](http://www.hadoopbook.com/), published by O'Reilly.

## Genomics

In June 2020, I started working for [Related Sciences](https://www.related.vc/) on [sgkit](https://github.com/pystatgen/sgkit), a statistical genetics toolkit based on PyData technologies like Dask, Xarray, and Zarr.

I ported the single cell preprocessing pipeline in [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/) so it could run in parallel using [Dask](https://dask.org/), and on GPUs using [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/).

I was the primary author of Spark support in [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/), working with members of the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) GATK team from 2015 to 2019. I also created [Disq](https://github.com/disq-bio/disq) for reading and writing bioinformatics sequencing formats from Spark.

## SciPy

I have made contributions to the dimensionality reduction software [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/) and the related project
[pynndescent](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent) (for calculating approximate nearest neighbours).

## Open Data

In early March 2020 I began [collating the disparate sources of UK COVID-19 data](https://github.com/tomwhite/covid-19-uk-data), by writing web crawlers to integrate the data for COVID-19 tests, confirmed cases, and deaths into a set of CSV files. My work has been used by many different individuals and organisations, including [John Burn-Murdoch's visualizations for the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest).

In 2019 I produced the data analyses and visualizations of Welsh school funding data, for the [Level the Playing Field](http://leveltheplayingfield.wales/) campaign for fair funding for schools in Wales.

## Visualization

In 2020 I wrote a [blog about data visualization](http://tom-e-white.com/datavision/), and created one new visualization per week - with no constraints on dataset, visualization type, or technology.

Over the years I've created many [geometric visualizations](/projects/visualization.html) in my spare time.

## Diabetes tech

In 2018 I was [diagnosed](http://tom-e-white.com/2018/04/type-1-diabetes.html) with Type 1 Diabetes, and since then I have written [various pieces of software](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Atomwhite+diabetes&ref=simplesearch) to help manage the condition.

## Games

I'm interested in board games and puzzles, and how to get computers to play them. Examples include: [Mastermind](https://github.com/tomwhite/mastermind), [SETÂ®](https://github.com/tomwhite/set-game), and [Futoshiki](https://github.com/tomwhite/futoshiki-hints).

## Retro computing

In 2022 I [refurbished](https://tom-e-white.com/2022/12/refurbishing-my-zx81.html) my first computer, a ZX81. I also [recovered](https://github.com/tomwhite/zx81-frogging) the first program I wrote for it from tape. And I've created a website for running programs from the book [Not Only 30 Programs for the Sinclair ZX81](https://tomwhite.github.io/zx81-not-only-30-programs/web/index.html).

Using an emulator I've re-run a [Mandelbrot Set drawing program](https://github.com/tomwhite/mandelbrot-1989) that I wrote for a later computer, an Atari ST.
