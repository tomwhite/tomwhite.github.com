Want to run a Cpu instensive script, but don't have spare cycles on your local machine? Use EC2 with this neat one-liner<br /><br />ec2-run-instance -f myscript<br /><br />or use the Elasticfox firefox plugin (screencast)<br /><br />Can run a script in one line, in a controlled environment. Can be used to run several scripts, in parallel, for testing.<br /><br />End of script can easily post result to S3, for later analysis. (E.g. s3cmd)<br /><br /><br />
