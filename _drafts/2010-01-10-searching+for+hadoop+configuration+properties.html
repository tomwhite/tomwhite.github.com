<div>A nice feature of O'Reilly's <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/">Safari Books Online</a> is the powerful search facility. I found this useful recently when <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780596521974?bookview=search">searching</a> for documention of a Hadoop configuration property in my book, <a href="http://www.hadoopbook.com/">Hadoop: The Definitive Guide</a>, since it returns the page numbers that the property is mentioned on.</div><div><br /></div><div>For example, a search for <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780596521974?bookview=search&amp;query=((%22io.sort.mb%22))">io.sort.mb</a> lists the pages where this configuration option appears, as well as a snippet of context. This works even if you are not a Safari subscriber.  In this case the main entry is on page 167, which, in case you don't have the book to hand and are a Safari subscriber, has the simple URL <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780596521974/167">http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780596521974/167</a> (9780596521974 is the book's ISBN).</div><meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8"><div><br /></div><div>For basic information about every Hadoop property (not all are covered in the book), you can consult the "default" XML file that defines the properties and their default values. A short textual description is provided for each property. For releases before 0.20.0, the configuration was in a single file,<i> hadoop-default.xml</i>, found in the <i>conf</i> directory of the distribution. This file is also rendered in HTML form in the documentation; here's the one for <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.18.3/hadoop-default.html">Hadoop 0.18.3</a>, for example. You can even link to a particular property by adding a URL fragment, such as <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.18.3/hadoop-default.html#io.sort.mb">#io.sort.mb</a>.</div><meta charset="utf-8"><div><br /></div><div>For release 0.20.0 and later, the default files have moved. The configuration file has been split into three, one for each of Hadoop Common, HDFS, and MapReduce. These files, <i><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/core-default.html">core-default.xml</a></i>, <i>hdfs-default.xml</i>, <i>mapred-default.xml</i>, are no longer in the <i>conf</i> directory. They are however in the <i>src</i> directory, in the <i>core</i>, <i>hdfs</i>, and <i>mapred</i> directories (respectively).</div><meta charset="utf-8">
