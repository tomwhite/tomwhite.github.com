I left Kizoom in early December last year, after having worked there since September 1999. In this post I briefly look back over the last 8 years.<br /><br />Kizoom was formed in April 1999 by Nick Knowles with the objective of exploiting the mobile application space. WAP was getting a lot of buzz in the UK, and we looked for a good target application. I had met Nick earlier that year while working with Mike Storey at a London Java Consultancy. Mike and I joined Nick in September to begin working on a WAP application. Damian Bown joined as CEO at the end of the year after meeting Nick at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Tuesday">First Tuesday</a>.<br /><br />We cast around for a bit before deciding to build a travel application. Travel, and in particular public transport, seemed like the only application that truly exploited the fact that the device it was being used on was <font style="font-style: italic;">mobile</font>. We thought that people want to answer questions like: "How to I get to B?", "Are there any problems with my journey to B?" <font style="font-style: italic;">while they are out and about</font>. Other ideas included a "meet your friends" application, but we didn't really develop this idea very far, and certainly not with the kind of social-graph mindset of today. We also had some thoughts about location-based services, but these were discounted because location detection was non-existent in the devices at the time.<br /><br />Our first application was a WAP rail journey planner. We screen-scraped Railtrack's website for the timetable data, and designed a tight mobile interface that worked well on <font style="font-style: italic;">the</font> must-have phone of the time, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_7110">Nokia 7110</a> (Nick had managed to get one on eBay). Nick's negotiating skills managed to get us a meeting with Railtrack, and somehow got them to bless the service and get an official timetable feed. This was a crucial breakthough - we now had a foot in the door.<br /><br />In April 2000 we launched a personalized rail journey planner for Railtrack to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/04/21/kizoom_wap_site_promises_joinedup/">great aclaim</a>. "Personalized" meant you could save journeys to use again later. We didn't have a relationship with the mobile operators at that stage so there was no user-identity token being passed through from the operator (except on UP Phones, if I recall correctly), which meant you had to log in, which was a bit painful on mobile. Still, a public personalized WAP site was a first in the industry.<br /><br />Over the years we have developed a number of innovative transport information services for the public, including:<br /><ul><li>Mobile services on all UK mobile operator portals for rail journey planning and departures and arrivals<br /></li><li>An SMS <a href="http://alerts.tfl.gov.uk/">London tube alerts service</a><br /></li><li>An SMS bus departure board query service</li><li>The <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">National Rail Journey Planner and knowledge base</a></li><li>Mobile services for <a href="http://www.transportdirect.info/TransportDirect/en/TDOnTheMove/TDOnTheMove.aspx">TransportDirect</a>.<br /></li><li>A number of services for displaying public transport information on maps, such as one for <a href="http://leicestertravel.info/">Leicester</a> which includes live bus departure information, traffic news, car park spaces and jam cams, and <a href="http://welsh-maps.kizoom.co.uk/">Wales</a> which shows bus stop codes for the SMS bus departures service</li><li>A personalized alerts service for monitoring train journeys. This product (codename "Clarence") which has not been released yet, also has tight integration with mobile.</li></ul>One of the best things about working in this sector is the richness of the information available, so there is massive scope for building interesting and useful services. On the flip side, I think where we missed an opportunity was using the huge amount of data available - realtime feeds, usage information etc. - to provide better aggregated information to users and also to improve the services over time. So I think there's still huge potential in that area to deliver some really compelling travel applications - and I look forward to see what Kizoom builds in the future.
